Assignment 1
Making and commiting changes trial.
I'm Eugene student ID 578091, I am working on my WPR A  ssignment 1 and this is a cool instrument to use for coding colabs.
I Wish we got to learn this as first years, it would have really helped us with the group assignments we had over the few months.
This is a fun subject and we have a great Lecturer :-)
